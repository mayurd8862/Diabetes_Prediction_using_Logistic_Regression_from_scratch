# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression
## Overview
This project aims to build a diabetes prediction model using logistic regression. Logistic regression is a common classification algorithm used in machine learning to predict binary outcomes, making it suitable for this task of predicting diabetes.

## Project Description
## Problem Statement
Diabetes is a prevalent health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prediction of diabetes can lead to better management and preventive measures. This project addresses the problem of predicting diabetes based on a set of input features, such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels.

## Technologies Used
1) Python
2) Scikit-Learn
3) Jupyter Notebook
4) Pandas
5) NumPy
6) Matplotlib
7) GitHub

## Data
The dataset used for this project is available in the data directory. It contains the following columns:

1) Pregnancies	
2) Glucose	
3) BloodPressure	
4) SkinThickness	
5) Insulin	
6) BMI	
7) DiabetesPedigreeFunction	
8) Age
9) Outcome (0: No Diabetes, 1: Diabetes)

## Model Training
The logistic regression model is trained on the dataset to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the input features.

## Results
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are displayed in the Jupyter Notebook.
